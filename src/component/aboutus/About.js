                    Why do few succeed and even though some people may share an equal level of passion and enthusiasm , they fail ?
                    They have insights , distinctions and startgies that allow them to acheive more quickly . 
                    So Here are first ever Galgotias Tedx
                    The theme of the tedx is breakthrough
                    The truth is success or the breakthrough is a journey and not the destination.
                    An empowering story or disempowering one is influenced most powerfully by the mental and 
                    emotional state you’re in at that moment in time.
                    Where focus goes, energy flows.
                    The tedx would contain some valuable talks by people who have attained different heights in different walks of life .
                    This would guide the students towards different path . 
                    There would be thrilling performances as well to hold the interest of the audience .
                    The attendenes of the tedx would be students which would one day be the future of our country . They will get idea from different walks of life that will help reach emmense success</span>

                  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
                  local, self-organized events that bring people together to

                  At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to
                  spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
                  local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
                  independently organized TED event
