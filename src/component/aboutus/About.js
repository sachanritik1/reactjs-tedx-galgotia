                    Why do few succeed and even though some people may share an equal level of passion and enthusiasm , they fail ?
                    They have insights , distinctions and startgies that allow them to acheive more quickly . 
                    So Here are first ever Galgotias Tedx
                    The theme of the tedx is breakthrough
                    The truth is success or the breakthrough is a journey and not the destination.
                    An empowering story or disempowering one is influenced most powerfully by the mental and 
                    emotional state youâ€™re in at that moment in time.
                    Where focus goes, energy flows.
                    The tedx would contain some valuable talks by people who have attained different heights in different walks of life .
                    This would guide the students towards different path . 
                    There would be thrilling performances as well to hold the interest of the audience .
                    The attendenes of the tedx would be students which would one day be the future of our country . They will get idea from different walks of life that will help reach emmense success</span>

                  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
                  local, self-organized events that bring people together to

                  At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to
                  spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
                  local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
                  independently organized TED event
